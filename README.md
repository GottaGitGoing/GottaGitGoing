<h1>A bit about things I've done.</h1>
<main>
 
<section>
<p> Here are a list of languages I have worked with. Below is a list of projects (or mini-projects :D) I have done either for my classes or on my own.
<ol>
  <li>C++</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Creating a <a href="https://github.com/GottaGitGoing/ShindlerProj3/tree/master/app">
		HashMap</a> (<a href="https://github.com/GottaGitGoing/proj3/tree/master/app">Chaining Approach</a>). Practicing Safe Memory Usage (School)</li>
		<li>Implementing Functionalities of a <a href="https://github.com/GottaGitGoing/proj4/tree/master/app">Text Editor</a> (School)</li>
		<li>Implementing <a href="https://gitlab.com/ArianBuckets/ics46_shindler_project5/-/tree/master/app">Priority Queues</a>,  
			<a href="https://gitlab.com/ArianBuckets/ics46_shindler_project4/-/tree/master/app">AVL Trees</a> to Solve specific problems (School)</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Python</li>
	<ul>
		<li> Writing a <a href="https://github.com/GottaGitGoing/WikiNameGame">Script</a> that given an initial wikipedia link, it will check to see how many clicks it takes to reach to your target wiki link (Hobby)(<strong>IN-PROGRESS</strong>)</li>
		<li>Writing a <a href="https://github.com/GottaGitGoing/Toll_Roads_Check">Script</a> that Checked a License Plate against Toll-Roads database continously (Hobby)</li>
		<li>Writing a <a href="https://github.com/GottaGitGoing/Login_Attempter">Script</a> that Tried to Log Into a System That Others were competing to login to.(Hobby)</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Java</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Wrote a Compiler For a Language.(School) Per the professor's academic honesty request, I cannot post the repo.
		However, it was CS 142A, with professor Brian Demsky. The grammar was for a made-up language called Crux. We wrote the grammar
			rules using ANTLR4. Which established the visitor pattern basics. We then wrote the appropriate visitor patterns for each 
			Parse-Tree. Afterwards, we implemented Type checking. (int, bool, arrays, functions) As the second to last step, we lowered it to a step
			where in the last step we can more easily create our CFG and write the machine code. (where we had to use x86 instructions to 
			place variables, return values, parameters... in the appropriate registers and making sure the machine code can be run when compiled through gcc.)

	</ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>CSS/HTML</li>
